PURPOSE
────────────────────────────────────────

This document describes a practical, repeatable way for humans
to move ideas, drafts, and designs into GitHub without losing
clarity, intent, or control along the way.

The purpose of this lifecycle is to:
• Give humans space to think, explore, and change their minds
• Make design intent visible before anything is committed
• Turn finalized decisions into explicit, durable artifacts
• Ensure changes are applied carefully and predictably

By separating design from execution, this lifecycle reduces
cognitive load, limits accidental drift, and improves
collaboration safety—especially when working with tools that
can infer, autocomplete, or improvise faster than humans intend.

The goal is not speed or automation.
The goal is confidence: knowing exactly what changed, why it
changed, and how it arrived where it did.


────────────────────────────────────────
LIFECYCLE — PROTOTYPING TO GITHUB DEPLOYMENT
────────────────────────────────────────

1. Work in scratchpad repository.

2. Scope out context and design goals.
   • Sources may include human design notes, chats, interchats,
     or other artifacts.
   • Output as CONTEXT-DESIGN.txt.
   • Make commits to add or modify CONTEXT-DESIGN.txt as
     understanding evolves.
   • This artifact captures intent and constraints but is not
     canonical.

3. Generate a clear commit plan based on the design goals.
   • Each commit MUST be self-contained.
   • This is the contract-obligation planning stage.
   • Output as COMMIT-PLAN.txt.
   • Once committed, the plan constrains execution unless
     explicitly amended.

   3.1 Commit 1 — Header Initialization
       • Generate the deliverable header with empty or
         placeholder values.
       • The document name (ARTIFACT_ID) is a best-effort,
         non-committal choice required for GitHub placement.

   3.2 Commit 2 — Document Backbone
       • Generate all section headers and structural
         scaffolding.
       • Establish document topology early.
       • INSERT operations should only occur later if design
         needs arise.

   3.n-2 Sanity and Continuity Check
       • Verify internal logic, consistency, and completeness.
       • No new concepts or formatting changes introduced here.

   3.n-1 Formatting Pass
       • Formatting and presentation only.
       • Correctness must already be resolved at this stage.

   3.n Final Commit — Header Finalization
       • Fill in all previously empty header fields.
       • Bind finalized identity and context to the completed
         artifact.

4. Perform the Human-Mediated Mechanical Application operation.
   • Execution should be purely mechanical.
   • If ambiguities or design conflicts surface, halt and return
     to step 2 or 3.

5. Deploy to authoritative domain.
   • Promote the finalized artifact from scratchpad to its
     canonical repository.
   • No further mutation occurs without a new lifecycle
     iteration.


────────────────────────────────────────
DEFINITION — HUMAN-MEDIATED MECHANICAL APPLICATION
────────────────────────────────────────

The Human-Mediated Mechanical Application (HMMA) is the act of
materializing an emitted change set into a repository verbatim.

The human functions solely as a transport and execution agent
for emitted instructions.

The human MUST NOT:
• Interpret intent
• Correct perceived errors
• Adjust formatting
• Merge or split changes
• Apply partial results

HMMA is not authorship, review, or approval.
It is a mechanical execution step.

If execution cannot be performed mechanically, HMMA MUST STOP.


────────────────────────────────────────
NON-GOALS
────────────────────────────────────────

This lifecycle does NOT aim to:

• Automate design decisions
• Replace human judgment during design or planning
• Validate correctness, quality, or desirability of artifacts
• Resolve ambiguity implicitly or heuristically
• Optimize workflows for speed or convenience
• Guarantee correctness beyond mechanical conformance

This lifecycle exists to externalize intent, constrain execution,
and preserve auditability — not to decide what should be built.


────────────────────────────────────────
HMMA INPUT ASSEMBLY
────────────────────────────────────────

User fills in the HMMA INPUT ASSEMBLY.

• The specific commit from COMMIT-PLAN (exactly one).
• The current document copied verbatim from GitHub.

All remaining HMMA content is copied verbatim.
The completed HMMA INPUT ASSEMBLY is pasted into the chat.


────────────────────────────────────────
HMMA EXECUTION RULES
────────────────────────────────────────

The Human-Mediated Mechanical Application (HMMA) is a
non-interpretive execution step.

The human MUST apply the emitted changes exactly as specified.
The human MUST NOT reinterpret, optimize, correct, or infer
intent.

Permitted actions:
• Copy the emitted commit message verbatim.
• Copy the emitted commit body verbatim, if present.
• Apply each FILE MODIFICATION exactly as specified.
• Verify sentinel footers are present where required.

Forbidden actions:
• Modifying wording, formatting, or structure.
• Resolving ambiguity by judgment or best guess.
• Introducing changes not explicitly emitted.
• Skipping or reordering specified operations.

Failure Handling:
• If any ambiguity, mismatch, truncation, or conflict is
  observed, execution MUST STOP immediately.
• The human MUST return control to design or planning stages
  without applying partial changes.

Completion Condition:
• The operation is complete only when all emitted changes have
  been applied mechanically and verified.

<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are to propose this commit for human execution.

Do NOT make assumptions.
Do NOT infer unstated intent.

Your output MUST include, in this order:

1. COMMIT MESSAGE — enclose in its own code block
   • Single-line, imperative
   • ≤ 72 characters
   • No rationale

2. COMMIT BODY (only if needed) — enclose in its own code block
   • If not needed, explicitly state:
     "No commit body required."

3. CHANGE SUMMARY — do not enclose in code block
   • Brief bullet list of what sections are affected

4. FILE MODIFICATIONS

   For every modified section, present one of the following
   operations:

   REPLACE:
   • Label: "REPLACE — <section name>"
   • BEFORE label (outside code block)
   • Code block with exact pre-change text
   • AFTER label (outside code block)
   • Code block with exact post-change text

   INSERT:
   • Label: "INSERT — <section name> — BEFORE|AFTER <anchor>"
   • Code block with exact inserted text

   Additional rules:
   • Operation labels MUST appear before any code blocks.
   • Code blocks must contain ONLY document text.
   • Do NOT include labels such as BEFORE, AFTER, INSERT, or
     REPLACE inside code blocks.
   • Do not use line numbers.
   • Do not omit unchanged surrounding context needed for
     clarity.

5. INSERTION INSTRUCTIONS
   • Explicitly state where each change goes.
   • Use section names or unique markers.
   • Enclose these markers in their own code block for clarity.
   • Never say "update as needed" or similar.

6. Sentinel Footer Rule
   • Every code block containing GitHub-bound document content
     MUST end with the exact line:
       ⟦END_OF_GITHUB_BOUND_CONTENT⟧
   • Commit message and commit body code blocks MUST NOT
     contain a sentinel.
   • Absence or alteration of the sentinel invalidates the
     emission.

Constraints:
• Changes must be minimal and scoped strictly to this commit.
• All changes must be additive or explicitly declared mutations.
• Stop after this commit.
• Do not preview future commits.

This output is an instruction set for a human performing the
commit.
