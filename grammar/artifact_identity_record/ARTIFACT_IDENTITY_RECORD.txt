EXPLANATION

Artifact Identity Record Specification — Canonical Definition

Purpose

This artifact defines the required identity record structure and fields
for deliverable artifacts.

The artifact identity record exists to make provenance, identity,
expression, association, and situational context explicit, while
deliberately refusing to encode authority, lifecycle, ordering,
evaluation, or temporal semantics.

Human vs Machine Interpretation

Identity field values are chosen by human authors and may be meaningful
and legible to them.

The constraints defined in this specification apply to how tooling,
automation, and orchestration interpret and act upon these values.

Tooling MUST treat all identity values as declarative inputs and MUST NOT
infer intent, authority, behavior, or lifecycle semantics beyond what is
explicitly specified by governing artifacts.

────────────────────────────────────────
ARTIFACT IDENTITY VS STRUCTURAL CONTAINER
────────────────────────────────────────

A deliverable artifact consists of exactly one artifact body file.

The artifact body file contains the artifact’s content.

The artifact directory is a structural container that exists to support:
• deterministic placement
• artifact identity record association
• structural discovery

This specification governs the structural container and its associated
artifact identity record.

It does not redefine artifact identity, which remains vested in the
artifact itself.

────────────────────────────────────────
ARTIFACT BODY FILE CARDINALITY
────────────────────────────────────────

Each deliverable artifact directory contains exactly one artifact body file.

The artifact body file is the sole bearer of artifact identity and content.

The presence of multiple artifact body files within a single artifact
directory is incompatible with the deliverable artifact model.

This specification assumes the exactly-one artifact body file invariant
but does not define discovery, validation, or enforcement mechanisms
for artifact body files.

Governance, invariants, or tooling external to this specification are
responsible for enforcing this constraint.

────────────────────────────────────────
APPLICABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification applies only to artifacts designated as deliverables.

It does not replace or override invariant sets.

────────────────────────────────────────
IDENTITY STRUCTURE (NORMATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

The artifact identity record is a standalone structural file.

Each deliverable artifact directory MUST contain exactly one file named:

IDENTITY.txt

IDENTITY.txt contains the complete artifact identity record.

The artifact identity record within IDENTITY.txt MUST be delimited by:

<IDENTITY>
</IDENTITY>

All required and optional identity fields MUST appear within this block.

────────────────────────────────────────
IDENTITY DISCOVERY & STRUCTURAL FAILURE
────────────────────────────────────────

Tooling and orchestration MUST locate the artifact identity record by
resolving IDENTITY.txt within the artifact directory.

Identity discovery is constrained exclusively to IDENTITY.txt.

A deliverable artifact is non-conforming if:
• IDENTITY.txt is missing
• more than one IDENTITY.txt exists
• IDENTITY.txt does not contain exactly one identity record block
• the identity record block is malformed or ambiguous

No fallback, inference, or recovery behavior is permitted.

────────────────────────────────────────
REQUIRED IDENTITY FIELDS
────────────────────────────────────────

The IDENTITY.txt MUST include all of the following fields.

EMITTER
-------

Identifies the role or chat instance that produced the artifact.
Encodes authorship and accountability only.


REQUESTED_BY
------------

Identifies the role or actor that requested production of the artifact.
Encodes request provenance only and does not imply approval or acceptance.


ARTIFACT_DOMAIN
---------------

ARTIFACT_DOMAIN declares the canonical domain in which an artifact
belongs.

It exists solely to support deterministic artifact routing
(e.g., repository selection).

ARTIFACT_DOMAIN:
• does not convey meaning
• does not imply authority

ARTIFACT_DOMAIN values are opaque labels governed externally.

This field may be referenced by routing rules.

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION
-----------------

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION declares the class of responsibility an artifact
belongs to for purposes of deterministic placement.

The value is selected by a human author and is used by tooling solely to
determine the path class (directory or directory tree) under which the
artifact is placed.

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION:
• does not identify an artifact
• does not convey authority


ARTIFACT_ID
-----------

ARTIFACT_ID declares the stable identity of a deliverable artifact.

A deliverable artifact is a directory-scoped identity unit, not a
single file.

ARTIFACT_ID identifies the artifact itself and is used to determine:
• the artifact directory name
• the artifact body filename within that directory

It is a human-chosen identifier selected for clarity and reference.
Tooling and orchestration MUST treat the value as opaque and MUST NOT
interpret internal structure, wording, or apparent meaning.

ARTIFACT_ID exists to uniquely identify an artifact independently of its
role, format, location, or lifecycle.

ARTIFACT_ID:
• is treated as opaque by machines
• does not convey authority
• remains stable across revisions and relocations

ARTIFACT_ID is the sole source of truth for artifact identity.

This field may be referenced by routing or naming rules.

ARTIFACT_FORMAT
---------------

Declares the primary form in which the artifact is expressed.
Sets reader and parsing expectations only.


ARTIFACT_GROUP
--------------

Declares one or more associative group labels for discoverability.
Groups are unordered and many-to-many.
Grouping does not imply priority, hierarchy, or replacement.

ARTIFACT_GROUP values MUST be separated using a semicolon (`;`) delimiter.

Example:
ARTIFACT_GROUP: VIDEO_POKER_GUI; UI_OVERLAY; HAND_EVAL

The order of group values is semantically meaningless.


CREATED_IN_CONTEXT
------------------

Declares the situational context under which the artifact was produced.
Describes circumstances or constraints, not evaluation or outcome.
Must not encode time, version, order, acceptance, or success.


────────────────────────────────────────
DETERMINISTIC PLACEMENT GRAMMAR
────────────────────────────────────────

This section defines the only valid deterministic mapping from
artifact identity record fields to artifact placement.

This grammar is normative and declarative.

Any deviation from this mapping is incorrect by definition, regardless
of tooling availability or enforcement status.

Placement is a pure, total function of the artifact identity record.
Given a valid identity record, the repository, path, filename, and
extension are uniquely determined.

Missing or invalid required fields cause placement to fail; no defaults,
fallbacks, or judgment are permitted.
Folder creation is a deterministic side effect of placement, not a
decision.

The placement of an artifact is derived as follows:

• ARTIFACT_DOMAIN determines the canonical repository
• ARTIFACT_FUNCTION determines the path class within the repository
• ARTIFACT_ID determines the artifact directory name
• ARTIFACT_ID also determines the artifact body filename
• ARTIFACT_FORMAT determines the file extension

The deliverable artifact is the directory as a whole.
The file within that directory is the artifact body.

No other fields may be used for placement derivation.

────────────────────────────────────────
OPTIONAL COLLABORATION FIELD
────────────────────────────────────────

COLLABORATION
-------------

Records a contributing collaborator and the context of their
contribution.

This field is OPTIONAL and MAY appear zero or more times.

Value format:
COLLABORATION: <NAME> FREE-FORM CONTEXT TEXT

Where:
• <NAME> identifies the collaborating role, chat, or entity
• All text following the closing `>` is free-form descriptive context

Example:
COLLABORATION: <UI_BASE_LAYOUT_CHAT> INITIAL GEOMETRY PASS
COLLABORATION: <ENGINEERING_REVIEW_CHAT> CONSTRAINT VALIDATION

Rules:
• Each COLLABORATION entry is independent
• Order carries no semantic meaning
• The field does NOT imply joint emission, approval, authority, or ownership
• The field records contribution context only


────────────────────────────────────────
LEGACY COMPATIBILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

Artifacts created prior to adoption of the structural IDENTITY.txt model
may have expressed identity information in embedded or ad hoc forms.

Such artifacts are considered legacy and are outside the normative
scope of this specification unless explicitly migrated.

Legacy identity representations are out of scope for this specification.

────────────────────────────────────────
INVARIANTS
────────────────────────────────────────

• All required identity fields are mandatory
• No identity field may imply authority, lifecycle, or ordering
• Identity values must remain truthful under reuse and reinterpretation
• Group delimiter choice carries no semantic meaning beyond separation
• COLLABORATION entries are descriptive and non-authoritative


────────────────────────────────────────
NON-GOALS
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification does not define:
• canonization
• acceptance
• versioning
• rollback
• workflow
• enforcement


────────────────────────────────────────
VALUE STYLE GUIDANCE (NON-NORMATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

This section provides recommended conventions for populating artifact
identity record fields. These conventions improve consistency and readability but
do not impose semantic meaning, authority, or enforcement.

Deviation from these conventions is permitted where clarity requires it.


----------------------------------------
General Principles
----------------------------------------

• Standardize shape, not meaning
• Prefer human-readable values over codes
• Avoid numbers, ordering, or lifecycle terms
• Avoid words that evaluate, judge, or imply status
• Treat all values as descriptive facts, not signals


----------------------------------------
Field-Specific Guidance
----------------------------------------

EMITTER
• Record the role or chat name exactly as it existed at the time of artifact creation
• Preserve capitalization, spelling, and wording as originally used
• Do not retroactively update values to reflect later renaming or restructuring
• Treat the value as historical provenance, not a canonical directory entry

REQUESTED_BY
• Record the requesting role or actor exactly as it existed at the time the request was made
• Preserve original capitalization, spelling, and wording
• Do not update values to reflect later role, title, or authority changes
• Treat the value as request provenance, not endorsement or approval

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation
• Use noun phrases
• Describe what the artifact is, not what it does
• Avoid lifecycle, status, or preference language

ARTIFACT_FORMAT
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation
• Single-word values are acceptable
• Multi-word values must use underscores
• Describe the dominant form of expression, not the tool or lifecycle

ARTIFACT_GROUP
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation for group names
• Separate multiple group values using semicolons (`;`)
• Treat groups as unordered labels
• Avoid hierarchy or implied priority

CREATED_IN_CONTEXT
• Use ALL CAPS
• Spaces are explicitly allowed
• Underscores may be used but are not required
• Prefer short descriptive phrases
• Describe circumstances or constraints, not outcomes
• Avoid numbers, phases, versions, or ordering terms

COLLABORATION
• Use the <NAME> prefix exactly as shown
• <NAME> should match the collaborator identifier as used elsewhere
• Context text may be brief or detailed
• Do not use this field to imply approval, authority, or joint emission


────────────────────────────────────────
CLOSING NOTE
────────────────────────────────────────

The artifact identity record is a fact surface, not a decision surface.

It exists to remain truthful under reuse, reinterpretation,
disagreement, and time.
