EXPLANATION

Deliverable Header Specification — Canonical Definition

Purpose

This artifact defines the required header structure and fields for
deliverable artifacts.

The header exists to make provenance, identity, expression, association,
and situational context explicit, while deliberately refusing to encode
authority, lifecycle, ordering, evaluation, or temporal semantics.

Human vs Machine Interpretation

Header field values are chosen by human authors and may be meaningful
and legible to them.

The constraints defined in this specification apply to how tooling,
automation, and orchestration interpret and act upon these values.

Tooling MUST treat all header values as declarative inputs and MUST NOT
infer intent, authority, behavior, or lifecycle semantics beyond what is
explicitly specified by governing artifacts.


────────────────────────────────────────
APPLICABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification applies only to artifacts designated as deliverables
within a delegated execution scope.

It does not replace or override:
• ledger headers
• protocol headers
• governance artifacts

Reuse outside deliverable artifacts requires explicit declaration elsewhere.


────────────────────────────────────────
HEADER STRUCTURE (NORMATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

All deliverable artifacts MUST include an explicit header block delimited by:

<DELIVERABLE_HEADER>
</DELIVERABLE_HEADER>

All header fields MUST appear within this block.

The deliverable body consists of all content following the closing
</DELIVERABLE_HEADER> tag.

No other markers are required to establish the header/body boundary.


────────────────────────────────────────
REQUIRED HEADER FIELDS
────────────────────────────────────────

All deliverable artifacts MUST include all of the following fields.


EMITTER
-------

Identifies the role or chat instance that produced the artifact.
Encodes authorship and accountability only.


REQUESTED_BY
------------

Identifies the role or actor that requested production of the artifact.
Encodes request provenance only and does not imply approval or acceptance.


ARTIFACT_DOMAIN
---------------

ARTIFACT_DOMAIN declares the canonical domain in which an artifact
belongs.

It exists solely to support deterministic artifact routing
(e.g., repository selection).

ARTIFACT_DOMAIN:
• does not convey meaning
• does not imply authority

ARTIFACT_DOMAIN values are opaque labels governed externally.

This field may be referenced by routing rules.
Omission is permitted only for legacy deliverable artifacts created
before adoption of this specification; newly created artifacts are
expected to include this field.


ARTIFACT_FUNCTION
-----------------

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION declares the class of responsibility an artifact
belongs to for purposes of deterministic placement.

The value is selected by a human author and is used by tooling solely to
determine the path class (directory or directory tree) under which the
artifact is placed.

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION:
• does not identify an artifact
• does not convey authority


ARTIFACT_ID
-----------

ARTIFACT_ID declares the stable identity of an artifact.

It is a human-chosen identifier selected for clarity and reference.
Tooling and orchestration MUST treat the value as opaque and MUST NOT
interpret internal structure, wording, or apparent meaning.

ARTIFACT_ID exists to uniquely identify an artifact independently of its
role, format, location, or lifecycle.

ARTIFACT_ID:
• is treated as opaque by machines
• does not convey authority
• remains stable across revisions and relocations

ARTIFACT_ID is the sole source of truth for artifact identity.

This field may be referenced by routing or naming rules.
Omission is permitted only for legacy deliverable artifacts created
before adoption of this specification; newly created artifacts are
expected to include this field.

ARTIFACT_FORMAT
---------------

Declares the primary form in which the artifact is expressed.
Sets reader and parsing expectations only.


ARTIFACT_GROUP
--------------

Declares one or more associative group labels for discoverability.
Groups are unordered and many-to-many.
Grouping does not imply priority, hierarchy, or replacement.

ARTIFACT_GROUP values MUST be separated using a semicolon (`;`) delimiter.

Example:
ARTIFACT_GROUP: VIDEO_POKER_GUI; UI_OVERLAY; HAND_EVAL

The order of group values is semantically meaningless.


CREATED_IN_CONTEXT
------------------

Declares the situational context under which the artifact was produced.
Describes circumstances or constraints, not evaluation or outcome.
Must not encode time, version, order, acceptance, or success.


────────────────────────────────────────
DETERMINISTIC PLACEMENT GRAMMAR
────────────────────────────────────────

This section defines the only valid deterministic mapping from
deliverable header fields to artifact placement.

This grammar is normative and declarative.

Any deviation from this mapping is incorrect by definition, regardless
of tooling availability or enforcement status.

Placement is a pure, total function of the deliverable header.
Given a valid header, the repository, path, filename, and extension are
uniquely determined.
Missing or invalid required fields cause placement to fail; no defaults,
fallbacks, or judgment are permitted.
Folder creation is a deterministic side effect of placement, not a
decision.

The placement of an artifact is derived as follows:

• ARTIFACT_DOMAIN determines the canonical repository
• ARTIFACT_FUNCTION determines the path class within the repository
• ARTIFACT_ID determines the filename
• ARTIFACT_FORMAT determines the file extension

No other fields may be used for placement derivation.

If a required field for placement is absent, placement is undefined
and the artifact is non-conforming.


────────────────────────────────────────
OPTIONAL COLLABORATION FIELD
────────────────────────────────────────

COLLABORATION
-------------

Records a contributing collaborator and the context of their
contribution.

This field is OPTIONAL and MAY appear zero or more times.

Value format:
COLLABORATION: <NAME> FREE-FORM CONTEXT TEXT

Where:
• <NAME> identifies the collaborating role, chat, or entity
• All text following the closing `>` is free-form descriptive context

Example:
COLLABORATION: <UI_BASE_LAYOUT_CHAT> INITIAL GEOMETRY PASS
COLLABORATION: <ENGINEERING_REVIEW_CHAT> CONSTRAINT VALIDATION

Rules:
• Each COLLABORATION entry is independent
• Order carries no semantic meaning
• The field does NOT imply joint emission, approval, authority, or ownership
• The field records contribution context only


────────────────────────────────────────
LEGACY COMPATIBILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

Artifacts created prior to adoption of the explicit header block may omit
the <DELIVERABLE_HEADER> / </DELIVERABLE_HEADER> delimiters.

For such artifacts:
• The header is interpreted as the contiguous block of header fields at
  the beginning of the artifact.
• Legacy markers such as <DELIVERABLE HEADER>, <END HEADER>, or
  <DELIVERABLE BODY BEGINS HERE> may be used to aid human interpretation.
• Absence of explicit header delimiters does not invalidate legacy artifacts.

All newly created deliverable artifacts MUST use the explicit header
block.


────────────────────────────────────────
INVARIANTS
────────────────────────────────────────

• All required header fields are mandatory
• No header field may imply authority, lifecycle, or ordering
• Header values must remain truthful under reuse and reinterpretation
• Group delimiter choice carries no semantic meaning beyond separation
• COLLABORATION entries are descriptive and non-authoritative


────────────────────────────────────────
NON-GOALS
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification does not define:
• canonization
• acceptance
• versioning
• rollback
• workflow
• enforcement


────────────────────────────────────────
VALUE STYLE GUIDANCE (NON-NORMATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

This section provides recommended conventions for populating deliverable
header fields. These conventions improve consistency and readability but
do not impose semantic meaning, authority, or enforcement.

Deviation from these conventions is permitted where clarity requires it.


----------------------------------------
General Principles
----------------------------------------

• Standardize shape, not meaning
• Prefer human-readable values over codes
• Avoid numbers, ordering, or lifecycle terms
• Avoid words that evaluate, judge, or imply status
• Treat all values as descriptive facts, not signals


----------------------------------------
Field-Specific Guidance
----------------------------------------

EMITTER
• Record the role or chat name exactly as it existed at the time of artifact creation
• Preserve capitalization, spelling, and wording as originally used
• Do not retroactively update values to reflect later renaming or restructuring
• Treat the value as historical provenance, not a canonical directory entry

REQUESTED_BY
• Record the requesting role or actor exactly as it existed at the time the request was made
• Preserve original capitalization, spelling, and wording
• Do not update values to reflect later role, title, or authority changes
• Treat the value as request provenance, not endorsement or approval

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation
• Use noun phrases
• Describe what the artifact is, not what it does
• Avoid lifecycle, status, or preference language

ARTIFACT_FORMAT
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation
• Single-word values are acceptable
• Multi-word values must use underscores
• Describe the dominant form of expression, not the tool or lifecycle

ARTIFACT_GROUP
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation for group names
• Separate multiple group values using semicolons (`;`)
• Treat groups as unordered labels
• Avoid hierarchy or implied priority

CREATED_IN_CONTEXT
• Use ALL CAPS
• Spaces are explicitly allowed
• Underscores may be used but are not required
• Prefer short descriptive phrases
• Describe circumstances or constraints, not outcomes
• Avoid numbers, phases, versions, or ordering terms

COLLABORATION
• Use the <NAME> prefix exactly as shown
• <NAME> should match the collaborator identifier as used elsewhere
• Context text may be brief or detailed
• Do not use this field to imply approval, authority, or joint emission


────────────────────────────────────────
CLOSING NOTE
────────────────────────────────────────

The deliverable header is a fact surface, not a decision surface.

It exists to remain truthful under reuse, reinterpretation,
disagreement, and time.
